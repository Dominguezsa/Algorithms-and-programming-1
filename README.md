# Algorithms-and-programming-1
Works carried out in the subject Algorithms and Programming 1 in the Faculty of Engineering (UBA).

- TP1: Sokoban. The first part of the practical work where the logic of the game that would be used in the following parts is worked on.

- EX2: five in line. An introductory exercise to learn how to use the Gamelib library provided by the course teacher and that would be used in subsequent work.

- TP2: Sokoban++. Second part of the practical work where you already work with a graphical interface using Gamelib and where, using the logic of the first part, you have to be able to play and pass to the next level. This programme reads another file which describes a great variety of different levels.

- TP3: Sokoban with graphics. Third and last part of the practical work where already having logic and graphical interface, it is necessary to add quite useful functionalities such as the possibility of using hints and undo/redo movements giving the player more options to pass the levels.

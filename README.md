# Algorithms-and-programming-1
This repository contains the works carried out in the subject "Algorithms and Programming 1" at the Faculty of Engineering (UBA).

- TP1: Sokoban. The first assessment required the student to establish the logic of the Sokoban game, which would be used in subsequent evaluations.

- EX2: five in line. An introductory exercise designed to teach students how to use the Gamelib library provided by the course instructor. This library would be used in subsequent assignments.

- TP2: Sokoban++. The second part of the assessment involved working with a graphical interface using Gamelib, a public graphics library. Building upon the logic developed in the first part, the objective was to implement the ability to play multiple levels. The program reads a file that describes various levels.

- TP3: Sokoban with graphics. The third and final part of the assessment required enhancing the previous logic and graphical interface of Sokoban. Additional functionalities were added, such as the ability to use hints and undo/redo movements, providing players with more options to successfully complete levels.
